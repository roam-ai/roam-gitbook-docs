# Cloud vs. Self-Managed

## What is Cloud Integration? <a id="What-is-Cloud-Integration?"></a>

Cloud integration is when we manage your data through our servers. This provides you with a system of tools and technologies that connects various applications and systems for real-time exchange of location data and processes including Insights, Trips, Geofencing and Nearby APIs.

Once integrated, we manage your data flowing through our servers and make sure to keep an uptime of above 99.5%.

## What is Self-Managed Integration? <a id="What-is-Self-Managed-Integration?"></a>

Self-managed integration is when you manage your data by sending all location data back to your server from the SDK directly without communicating with our server. This allows you to keep complete privacy of your data and manage your security standards.

Our cloud services system for the real-time exchange of location data and processes including Insights, Trips, Geofencing and Nearby APIs will be available through AWS, GCP and Azure Marketplaces. This will allow you to install services in one click and manage them at your own will.

#### **Benefits of Self Integration:** <a id="benefits-of-self-integration"></a>

Companies that use self-managed integration have better privacy and security, improving their ability to control and manage data more efficiently.

#### Other benefits include: <a id="other-benefits-include-1"></a>

* Increased flexibility and control over data
* Better internal security standards.

**What products are available with Self Managed Integration?**
