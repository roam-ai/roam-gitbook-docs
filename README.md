# Introduction

Add location components into your mobile app with just a few lines of code!

Roam Docs contain instructions about how to effectively integrate and use our location SDKs and APIs. Each section will take you through the step-by-step process with source code, examples, and references.

## **SDKs**

Roam SDK is a convenient Software Development Kit that helps you easily add [location tracking](https://geospark.co/knowledgebase/tag/location-tracking/) to your app, without the complexity of REST API calls. Accurate, battery efficient and customizable location tracking is our main product with the following features:

* **Always-on location tracking** to track users’ location at all times regardless of the application state \(foreground, background, terminated\)
* **Offline location tracking** to track users’ location even if they’re offline.
* **Location spoofing prevention** prevents your users from faking their location.
* **Location tracking modes** to customize the setup and optimize between the battery usage and data collection frequency.

## **APIs**

Our REST APIs allow you to go beyond simple location tracking:

* [Geofencing](https://geospark.co/knowledgebase/tag/geofencing/) - static and moving geofences with events. 
* [Insights](https://geospark.co/knowledgebase/tag/insights/) - detailed location information about your users' patterns.
* [Trips](https://geospark.co/knowledgebase/tag/trips/) - full trip management for mobility and on-demand services. 
* [Search](https://geospark.co/knowledgebase/tag/search/) - find nearby users and geofences.
